  <h1>Dear My Love 💖</h1>
  <p>
    Happiest birthday to you. Thank you for existing and being in my life. You are my heart and soul.
    I was thinking how can I surprise you, and then I thought I should do something I'm best at,
    so here — I hope this makes you feel loved and important.<br><br>
    You are my happy place. You are my home. Without you, I feel like I’m running out of breath.
    You made me feel truly loved. After you, I really want to be with someone forever.
    After you, I want to be loyal — like it’s you or no one else.<br><br>
    Thank you for loving me so hard, never giving up on me, always staying beside me,
    and being my smile. I belong to you, now and forever — and I mean it.<br><br>
    I love you, <b>mere Santre Bille 🧡</b>

    <h2>In Your Name, My Life</h2>
    <p>
      Without you, what meaning does life even hold?<br>
      Like a heartbeat… without any feeling to it.<br><br>
      When you’re near, even the hardest moments feel light,<br>
      Like finding shade in the middle of harsh sunlight.<br><br>
      Just one smile from you — I relive my whole day again.<br>
      Just one “yes” from you — I fight back every “no” the world throws at me.<br><br>
      You’re my morning. You’re my night.<br>
      Without you, every second feels nameless.<br><br>
      You are not just love… you are my peace.<br>
      With you, every tangled thought finds its answer.<br><br>
      I stumble — you steady me.<br>
      I hide — you find me.<br><br>
      Without you, I exist… but I’m incomplete.<br>
      With you, I’m whole. 💫
